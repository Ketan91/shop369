                <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
                <p>Shop369 aim is to ensure that you receive a reliable, effective, and functional service when browsing on our Site. On occasion, services provided on the Internet need to save certain information on your device (computer, cell phone, tablet etc.) using small files called "cookies".
                </p>
                <p>These text files are saved to your computer when you visit a site or view an ad. Your web browser handles them and only the issuer of a cookie is likely to read the information it contains.</p>
            

                <div class="mt-3"></div>
                <h3>SHOP369 uses cookies on its Site to, among other things:</h3>
                <p>Measure and analyze the audience for each page in order to subsequently improve the ergonomics, browsing, or visibility of content; Measure the reliability of its Site by analyzing the number of visits to its pages in real time, and offer varied ads that are adapted to usersâ€™ areas of interest; Recognize previously identified users whenever they connect (so users are not repeatedly asked for their username and password for each webpage they visit). Social media tools may also save cookies if you use these functionalities (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.). Cookies can be divided into several types: functional cookies, user experience personalization cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies, and social network cookies. </p>
                <p>Besides how they are used, cookies may also be classified according to their issuer: Internal cookies are saved directly by SHOP369 (also called first-party cookies); Third-party cookies are saved by companies of the group or by SHOP369 partners, which are usually advertising partners. Cookies may consist of (session) cookies that only last for as long as the site is being visited, or may consist of cookies of a longer duration, which allow information from one visit to be memorized until the next.</p>

                <h3>Internal cookies saved by Shop369 </h3>
                <p>Internal cookies that are directly saved by SHOP369 are mainly functional cookies. They are saved on your device primarily for the browsing needs on our Site, identification, and for the optimization and personalization of our services and content.</p>
                <p>These functional cookies serve the following purposes:</p>
                <ul class="list" style="padding-left: 37px;">
                    <li><b>User authentication cookies:</b> Authentication cookies allow you to access your account using the username you have already provided us with.</li>
                    <li><b>Personalization cookies:</b> Personalization cookies make it possible to adapt the appearance of our Site to the display preferences on your device (language, display resolution, operating system, security settings, etc.) whenever you visit our Site, all according to the tools and software for viewing and playing media present on your device.</li>
                    <li><b>Statistics cookies:</b> Statistics cookies allow us to ascertain the use and performance of our Site and improve its functioning. To accomplish this, these cookies track your browsing in order to establish statistics on visits. For the most part, these cookies are saved and used by SHOP369</li>
                    <li><b>Audience measurement cookies:</b> SHOP369 uses audience measurement cookies (including Google Analytics) to obtain anonymous visitor statistics for its Site, which are then used to optimize it by analyzing the browsing activity of users and detecting any potential malfunctions.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>Cookies saved by third parties; these are cookies saved on your device by non-affiliated companies when you browse on our Site, or when you click on an advertisement on our Site. Advertising cookies are saved by non-affiliated companies (like advertisers, advertising agencies, communications consulting agencies, audience measurement companies, providers of targeted advertising, etc.) through the advertising spaces on our Site; the operation of these spaces helps pay for the content and services that we provide to you free of charge.</p>
                    <p>First and foremost, these cookies allow us to record the total number of ads viewed in our advertising spaces, to identify these ads, their number of respective views, the number of users who have clicked on each ad, and where applicable, the actions then taken by these users on the sites where these ads take them, all in order to calculate amounts owed to members of the advertising distribution chain (communications agency, advertising agency, distribution site/media) and to establish statistics.</p>
                    <p>These advertising cookies also allow us to adjust the advertising content displayed on your device in our advertising spaces in accordance with the browsing behavior of your device on our Site, or even on the location data transmitted by your device, where applicable (behavioral advertising). This allows you to see the advertisement we believe to be the most suitable for the user profile on your device. These cookies also allow us to limit the number of times you see the same ad on the same media.</p>
                    <p>We do not always have final control over these cookies saved by non-affiliated companies that act independently. Such cookies are subject to the privacy protection policies of said third parties. </p>
                    <p>Social networks providing a share button will likely identify you using this function, even if you have not used this button during your visit. This type of button can allow the social network in question to track your browsing behavior on our Site simply because your social network account was activated on your device (open session) during your visit.</p>
                    <p>We have no control over the process used by social networks to collect information on your browsing of our Site and information pertaining to the personal data in their possession. We suggest you consult the privacy protection policies of these social networks to learn about how browsing information collected by them through the use of these application buttons (e.g., for advertising), and ways to disable their tracking functions.</p>
